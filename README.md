# Scrum-TimeboxedEvents-Cheatsheet
Markdown text sample of Scrum Time-boxed Events to use with welcome page of developer team site

Scrum events are defined in [Scrum.org Scrum Guide](https://www.scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html).

When we create a new developer time site, we want to share these events in dashboard page of the site.
I always create a markdown file "README.md" in team site and I write this cheat-sheet in the file.
These are the samples.

 | Event | Time-Box | Start |
 ----|----|----
 | Sprint |  1week = Sprint  | |
 | Sprint Review   | 1 hour / Sprint| Friday 10:00 |
 | Sprint Planning meeting  | 2 hours / Sprint| Friday 13:00 |
 | Daily Scrum | 15 min. / Day| 8:45 |
 | Sprint Retrospective | 45 min. / Sprint| Friday 11:00 |
 
 This repository contains samples in English and Japanese.
